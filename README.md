A Combined version of all the remastered games for ESD Submissions all in one C++ File.

This is a testimony to my skills I've gathered throughout the years used to remaster
Pong, Breakout, Space Invaders, And last but not least, Angry Birds.

I will also include a menu system to browse games which should be it's own class, and will be the sole
focus for this project.
